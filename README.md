# CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREDICTOR USING MACHINE LEARNING
# Problem:
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using Decision Tree Classifier.

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle Binary Classification with Sklearn.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
